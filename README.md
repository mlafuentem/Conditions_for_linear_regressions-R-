# Conditions_for_linear_regressions-R-
R code: 4 Functions to test linear regression assumptions (linearity, homoskedasticity, autocorrelation, normality of errors). Soon to be added a function to test multicolinearity. This includes recommendations to fix unmet conditions, and solutions!
If you have any suggestions to improve the functions, please let me know.
